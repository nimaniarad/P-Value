```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r cars}
# P-Values Concept 

# Using Heart Disease UCI Data Set :https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci 

library(readr)
Heart <- read_csv("C:/Nima/Rstudio/Git/Data/Heart Disease UCI.csv")

# Let's know our variables more:

names(Heart)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
