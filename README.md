# P-Value
I am going to talk about the P-Value and its concept here. It is a little hard to understand what is going on with this guy! 

That is why I've decided to explain it with an example. It is not a technical one, maybe it is not even a true example based on P-Value concepts, but I hope it can help to simplify it.
